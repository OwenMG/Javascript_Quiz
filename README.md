# Javascript_Quiz
This was the 4th homework assignment for the BCS Full Stack Bootcamp.

We were tasked with creating a javascript quiz from scratch.

I began by creating the html and css for a basic introduction, quiz field, and timer.

I then used javascript to create question content as objects, run the timer, and other logic. 

Through much trial and error I got everything working, and in the future would like to implement a randomized question order on repeat attempts!
